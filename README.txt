Lab 2 deals with implementing a new way to schedule processes by changing how priorities work and how processes are inserted and read from the readyList.
1. Priorities are now in ascending order, from lowest to highest, with min value of -20 to max value of 20.
2. Processes have added fields to calculate CPU usage time and new priority-necessary values.
3. Include a process called system to change the base priority of a process from a user process to a system process
